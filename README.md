# Rental Buddy: AI-Powered Rental Property Search

**Rental Buddy** is an AI-driven real estate assistant designed to streamline the process of finding rental properties. Built as a Google Capstone Project, it leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Google's Generative AI, ChromaDB vector database, and LangChain/LangGraph for a conversational, user-friendly property search experience. This project processes a dataset of 10,000 rental listings, enabling semantic searches, property management, and visit planning.

## üìù Overview

This project is implemented in a Jupyter notebook, combining data processing, vector embeddings, and a conversational AI workflow to assist users in finding and organizing rental properties. Key functionalities include:

- **Data Processing**: Loads and cleans a 10,000-row rental dataset, preparing it for semantic search.
- **Semantic Search**: Uses Google's `text-embedding-004` model to generate embeddings and ChromaDB for efficient querying.
- **Conversational Workflow**: Employs LangChain and LangGraph to manage multi-turn conversations, allowing users to search, save, remove, and group properties for visits.
- **Visit Planning**: Clusters properties geographically using KMeans and generates Google Maps URLs and summary cards for trip planning.

**Note**: This README covers the full notebook (33 cells), including data setup, embedding generation, vector storage, tool definitions, and the LangGraph conversational workflow.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Kaggle Dataset Integration**: Imports the `rental-10k-dataset` (10,000 rental listings) via `kagglehub`.
- **Robust Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, standardizes columns, and drops irrelevant fields, reducing the dataset to 2,570 clean records with 19 features.
- **Semantic Search**: Embeds property listings using Google's `text-embedding-004` model and stores them in ChromaDB for natural language queries (e.g., "2 bedroom apartment in Chicago under $2000 with parking").
- **Structured Data Models**: Uses Pydantic (`PropertyJson`) for property validation and `TypedDict` (`Pstate`, `TripDict`) for state management.
- **Conversational AI**: Implements a stateful LangGraph workflow with tools for querying, saving, removing, and grouping properties, powered by `gemini-2.0-flash`.
- **Visit Planning**: Clusters properties into visit groups using KMeans and generates Google Maps URLs and detailed summary cards for each trip.
- **Error Handling**: Includes retry logic for API calls, validation for data integrity, and detailed logging for debugging.

## üöÄ Project Structure

The notebook is organized into the following sections:

1. **Kaggle Data Import** (Cells 1-2):
   - Uses `kagglehub` to authenticate and download the `rental-10k-dataset` (`apartments_for_rent_classified_10K.csv`).

2. **Package Installation** (Cell 3):
   - Installs required libraries: `chromadb`, `google-generativeai`, `langchain`, `langgraph`, `pydantic`, `scikit-learn`, etc.

3. **Library Imports & Constants** (Cell 4):
   - Imports libraries and defines constants (`GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `DATA_URL`, `COLLECTION_NAME`, `EMBEDDING_MODEL`).

4. **Data Loading & Cleaning** (Cells 5-6):
   - Loads the dataset (10,000 rows, 22 columns) with `pd.read_csv` (semicolon-separated, `cp1252` encoding).
   - Cleans data by stripping whitespace, dropping missing values (to 2,570 rows), and removing irrelevant columns (`category`, `has_photo`, `time`).

5. **ChromaDB Setup & Embedding** (Cells 7-8):
   - Initializes Google Generative AI client and a custom `GeminiEmbeddingFunction` with retry logic.
   - Embeds cleaned property listings (as JSON strings) and stores them in a ChromaDB collection (`Rental_Listings`) in batches of 100.

6. **ChromaDB Query Testing** (Cells 9-10):
   - Tests semantic search with a sample query ("I want 5 properties from Illinois"), retrieving 5 properties from Chicago, IL, with prices between $1,755 and $3,675.

7. **Data Models & State** (Cells 11-12):
   - Defines `PropertyJson` (Pydantic) for property validation, `TripDict` for visit groups, and `Pstate` for workflow state (messages, property set, trips).

8. **Tool Definitions** (Cells 13-18):
   - `query_properties`: Searches ChromaDB for properties matching user requirements.
   - `add_to_property_set`: Adds properties to the state‚Äôs `property_set`, ensuring no duplicates and validating with `PropertyJson`.
   - `remove_from_property_set`: Removes properties by index from `property_set`.
   - `generate_groups_for_visits`: Clusters properties into `n_trips` groups using KMeans based on latitude/longitude.
   - `generate_visit_plan`: Generates Google Maps URLs and summary cards for each trip using `gemini-2.0-flash`.

9. **LLM & System Instructions** (Cell 19):
   - Initializes `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` with `gemini-2.0-flash` (temperature=0.7).
   - Defines `REAL_ESTATE_AGENT_SYSINT` with instructions for conversational flow and tool usage.

10. **Agent & Routing Logic** (Cells 20-21):
    - Defines `agent_node` to invoke the LLM and `should_continue` for routing between `agent`, `tools`, or `END`.
    - Constructs and compiles the LangGraph workflow with nodes (`agent`, `tools`) and conditional edges.

11. **Interactive Chat Session** (Cells 22-23):
    - Implements a loop for user interaction, processing inputs, invoking the graph, and displaying responses.
    - Supports commands like "quit" to exit and handles errors gracefully.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

1. **Environment**:
   - Use Google Colab or Kaggle Notebook with GPU support (optional, as per notebook metadata: `T4` GPU, though not used in provided cells).

2. **Prerequisites**:
   - **Google API Key**: Set `GOOGLE_API_KEY` as a Kaggle secret (`kaggle_secrets.UserSecretsClient`) or environment variable.
   - **Dataset**: Ensure `rental-10k-dataset` is available in your Kaggle environment (`/kaggle/input/rental-10k-dataset/apartments_for_rent_classified_10K.csv`).

3. **Steps**:
   - Clone or download the notebook (`Copy_of_Google_CapStone_Project_Rental_Buddy.ipynb`).
   - Run cells sequentially to:
     - Install dependencies (Cell 3).
     - Load and clean data (Cells 5-6).
     - Set up ChromaDB and embed listings (Cells 7-8).
     - Define models, tools, and workflow (Cells 11-21).
     - Start the interactive chat (Cell 22).
   - For the chat session, enter natural language queries (e.g., "Find 2 bedroom apartments in Chicago under $2000") or commands like "quit".

4. **Example Interaction**:
   - Input: "Find me 2 bedroom apartments in Chicago between $1000 and $2000 with a gym."
   - Output: Lists matching properties, allows saving to `property_set`, removing by index, grouping into trips, and generating visit plans.
   - Note: The provided notebook output suggests issues with tool execution (pseudo-tool calls not executed) and potential data hallucination. Ensure proper tool integration in your environment.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

- **Tool Execution**: The notebook output indicates that tool calls (e.g., `query_properties`) are output as code blocks rather than executed, suggesting a potential issue with `langchain` tool binding or LLM configuration.
- **Data Consistency**: Some responses include fabricated property details (e.g., "Luxury 2 bed 2 bath in Streeterville!") not present in the dataset, indicating possible LLM hallucination.
- **Validation Errors**: Adding properties to `property_set` may fail due to missing `id` fields in fabricated data, requiring stricter validation or real dataset integration.
- **Map URL Generation**: Relies on `gemini-2.0-flash` for Google Maps URLs, which may produce inconsistent or invalid results without proper validation.
- **Partial Notebook**: The provided README was based on Cells 1-14 initially, but this updated version accounts for all 33 cells. Ensure all cells are present for full functionality.

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- **Fix Tool Execution**: Debug and ensure proper tool integration with `langchain` and `langgraph` to execute `query_properties`, `add_to_property_set`, etc., correctly.
- **Prevent Hallucination**: Enforce stricter reliance on dataset metadata and tool outputs to avoid fabricated property details.
- **Enhance Map URLs**: Validate and refine Google Maps URL generation, possibly integrating Google Maps API for more reliable results.
- **User Interface**: Develop a front-end (e.g., using Streamlit or Flask) to make the assistant more accessible beyond the notebook.
- **Advanced Features**: Add filters for amenities, pet policies, or proximity to landmarks, and optimize clustering for travel time.
